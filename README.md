New Bedford Steel (NBS) procures coking coal to produce steel.

Refer to Data.png and Jupyter notebook Supplier selection.ipynb.

## Problem:
NBS wants to procure 1,225mt of coking coal with an average volatility of at least 19%. To avert adverse labour relations, at least 50% of the coal should come from union mines. Moreover, at most 650mt (720mt) can be transported via rail (trucks).

How much should NBS procure from each mine so as to minimize total costs? What are the total costs? What are the average costs per mt?
